# MNIST_adam

Just like programming's Hello World, machine learning has MNIST, a simple computer vision dataset.
 It consists of images of handwritten digits;my model is trained to look at those images and predict what digits they are.
 
 This model isn't designed to be state-of-the-art, but still recognizes the images at a 99.2% success rate using an Adam Optimizer algorithm and three neural layers.

This algorithm uses Tensorflow, a powerful library for doing large-scale numerical computations.
